## JavaScript Variables
Variable is just like container (storage area) to hold data. 


### Variable Declaration
A declaration of a variable is where a program says that it needs a variable.
```http
  int x, y, z;                // declare 3 variables.
```

### Variable Initalization
Initialization is the process of assigning a value to the Variable. 
```http
  int marks = 90;             // declare and initialize variable marks 
```
